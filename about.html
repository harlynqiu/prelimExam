              <p>
                Most often, when asking who “Harlyn Nichole Qiu” is, not much can say. 
                The reason for this is because she likes to keep things to herself and 
                only allows a certain number of people to get to know her. Born and raised in Davao City, Philippines, Harlyn is the eldest among her siblings. She is raised in a Chinese household so her views and practices follow the Chinese standards. As the eldest among the siblings, she bears the responsibilities of an “atsi” (Chinese term for sister).
