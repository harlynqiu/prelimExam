                          Most often, when asking who “Harlyn Nichole Qiu” is, not much can say. 
                          The reason for this is because she likes to keep things to herself and 
                          only allows a certain number of people to get to know her. Born and raised in Davao City, Philippines.
                          Harlyn is the eldest among her siblings. She is raised in a Chinese household so her views and practices follow the Chinese standards. As the eldest among the siblings, she bears the responsibilities of an “atsi” (Chinese term for sister).

                          Harlyn likes to travel often and because she can travel, she creates “travel vlogs”. It has become her hobby. There are videos that she created during her teen years, 
                          so if you want to watch them, just go to the dashboard and click the link. Aside from her travelling hobby, she is frequent in sports. She used to do soccer, swimming, 
                          badminton, all the sports there is to know but currently she dwells in the sport Triathlon.
